Lot of stuff...

At now, it only opens manfiles, and show it in richtext (with man2html).

Must do:
html2man, for converting the new or modified manpage to manpage format (nroff).
The preferences options, must work (now they are only a useless mockup).
Compile man2html with the rest of the source (fix cmake instructions)
Others...
